<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>You calculated the number of wins and draws in the previous stages. By also calculating the number of losses, you can create the following stacked bar chart for some German clubs:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="Stacked bar chart of some German club performances" height="350" name="stack bar chart of club performance.svg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/357df8c3-c394-45d1-872b-8c8acb09345a/" width="466"/></picture></p>
<p>Among the three Bundesliga clubs shown in the chart, VfL Wolfsburg had the most wins, SV Werder Bremen had the most draws, and VfB Stuttgart had the most losses.</p>
<p>In this stage, you will focus on analyzing the performance of West Ham United (WHU) during the 2014/2015 football season. You will calculate the total points WHU earned throughout the season. You may need to incorporate conditional logic to determine points based on match results and whether WHU played at home or away. </p>
