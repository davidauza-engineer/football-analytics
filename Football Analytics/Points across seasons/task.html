<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In the final stage of this project, you will extend your analysis to compare the performance of two teams, West Ham United (WHU) and Crystal Palace (CRY), across multiple seasons.</p>
<p>You will write and execute SQL queries to fetch the points earned by each team in the 2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016 seasons. You may write a function that you can reuse to perform the points calculations repeatedly for each season. The visualization for the performance of both teams is shown below:</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>To complete this stage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to the SQLite database file named <code class="language-python">database.sqlite</code> using <code class="language-python">sqlite3</code>.</li>
<li>Write a Python function to generate SQL queries for fetching the points earned by a team in a given season.</li>
<li>Execute the function for both WHU and CRY across the 2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016 seasons.</li>
<li>Print the results as a list of lists in the order shown in the example.</li>
</ol>
