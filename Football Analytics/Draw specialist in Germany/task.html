<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>After calculating the number of wins for each team in the previous stage, you can visualize the distribution using a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="Density plot of wins" height="320" name="Density plot of wins.svg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6e2525f8-a12e-4893-b96e-d8d55eccdd7c/" width="426"/></picture></p>
<p>The plot shows that the most prolific teams scored over 200 goals, while most teams scored fewer than 50 goals.</p>
<p>In this stage, you will delve deeper into the football match data, focusing specifically on the German league. The goal is to identify the teams with the most drawn matches.</p>
<p>You can perform most of your analysis using either an SQL query or by manipulating the data with Pandasâ€”your choice. By the end of this stage, you will have a list of the top 3 teams in Germany with the highest number of drawn matches.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>To complete this stage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to the SQLite database file named <code class="language-python">database.sqlite</code> using <code class="language-python">sqlite3</code>.</li>
<li>Perform data analysis using SQL and Pandas to count the number of draws for each team in the German league.</li>
<li>Print the top 3 teams with the highest number of draws as a sorted list of lists.</li>
</ol>
