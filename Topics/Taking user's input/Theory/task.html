<p>Finally, let's summarize everything we've learned:</p>
<ul><li><p>You can process <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47680" target="_blank" title="In Python, user input refers to the data or value that is entered by the user and read by a program. | This input is typically obtained using the `input()` function, which displays a prompt to the user and waits for them to enter a value. The function then returns the entered value as a string, which can be stored in a variable for later use. It is important to note that user input can be unpredictable and may not always be in the expected format, so it is often necessary to validate and/or convert the input before using it in a program.">user input</a> with the <code class="java">input()</code> function;</p></li><li><p>You may include a message for the user with the input prompt;</p></li><li><p>The <code class="java">input()</code> function has no limit on the length of data entered and will wait until the user hits Enter;</p></li><li><p>This function treats all entered values as strings;</p></li></ul>
<p>In the very next lesson, you will learn how to convert the input data to the data type you need later on. So, keep learning!</p>
