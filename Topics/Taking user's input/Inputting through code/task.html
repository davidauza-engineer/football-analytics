<p>The input data we want to get is simply the value the user enters. The <code class="language-python">input()</code> function captures this value and returns it as a string.</p><p>For example, the program below reads the user's name and prints a greeting.</p><pre><code class="language-python">user_name = input()
print('Hello, ' + user_name)</code></pre><p>In the first line, the program waits for the user to enter something and saves this input in a variable for later use.</p><p>Since you know about variables and the <code class="language-python">print()</code> function, can you guess the output of our program if the user enters <code class="language-python">Hyperskill</code> as an input?</p>
