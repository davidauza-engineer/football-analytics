<div class="step-text">
<p>Another way to do this is to print the message separately:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('Enter your name: ')
user_name = input()
print('Hello, ' + user_name)</code></pre><p>There's no big difference actually: in the previous example, the input will be printed in the same line as the message, while in this case it will be entered on the next line. So, how many lines will be printed when executing the program above?</p>
</div>
