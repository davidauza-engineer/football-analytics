<p>Let's summarize our lesson:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Variables</strong>: Think of them as labeled storage units for your values. Use the equal sign (=) to assign a value and call the variable by its name to get its stored value. You can change the value of a variable anytime and even assign different types of values to the same variable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Naming Rules</strong>: <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47536" target="_blank" title="In Python, a variable name is a unique identifier given to a variable, which is used to refer to a memory location where a value is stored. | Naming variables carefully is essential for writing clear and understandable code, as programmers often need to read and comprehend code written by others. Python's style guide, PEP 8, provides rules for naming variables, such as using lowercase letters with underscores separating words, and avoiding reserved words. Additionally, it is a best practice to choose variable names that accurately reflect their purpose and usage in the code.">Variable names</a> should start with a letter or an underscore and can include letters, digits, and underscores. Remember, they're case-sensitive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Reserved Keywords</strong>: Don’t use Python’s reserved words as variable names.</p></li><li><p><strong>Descriptive Names</strong>: Choose meaningful, concise names for better readability. Avoid overly long or cryptic names.</p></li></ul>
