<p style="text-align: start">Python won't stop you from choosing any variable name that follows the rules we've discussed. But here's a valuable tip:</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p style="text-align: start">Avoid using cryptic variable names that don't convey their purpose.</p></div><p style="text-align: start">For example, if you want to store your friend Mike's age in a variable, you could write:</p><pre><code class="java">x = 5</code></pre><p style="text-align: start">But that's not recommended. Instead, use something more descriptive but concise, and remember to use underscores to separate the words, like this:</p><pre><code class="java">age_of_mike = 5</code></pre><p style="text-align: start">Trust us, you'll thank us later for this wonderful suggestion!</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Time for a test. Can you please select the best variable name from the list below?</strong></p>
