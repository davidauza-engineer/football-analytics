The `break` statement may be said to jump out of the loop where it was placed. For example, if you want to stop the loop before it iterates for the last time, you can introduce a condition when the loop should be stopped. If the condition is true, the iteration continues. If the condition is false, the loop execution is terminated and the program control moves further to the next operation. Other loop control statements include `continue` and `pass`, which allow you to skip a set of values, terminate an endless loop, or even do nothing.">Loop control statements</a> are nested inside loops and designed to change their typical behavior. In this topic, we'll find out how they work and what they are used for.</p>
<h5 id="break">Break</h5>
<p>The <strong>break </strong>statement is used to terminate a loop of any type (i. e. <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> </strong>and <code class="language-python">while</code><strong> </strong>loops). It may be said that <strong>break </strong>"jumps out" of the loop where it was placed. Let’s examine a tiny example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'parrot']
for pet in pets:
    print(pet)
    if pet == 'cat':
        break
</code></pre>
<p>We wanted to stop the loop before it iterated for the last time. For that purpose, we introduced a condition when the loop should be stopped. The output is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dog
cat
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful where you put <code class="language-python">print()</code>. If you put it at the loop’s end, the output will return only the first value – ‘dog’. This happens because <strong>break </strong>exits from the loop immediately.</p>
<p>Often enough, <strong>break </strong>is used to stop endless <code class="language-python">while</code> loops like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">count = 0
while True:
    print("I am Infinite Loop")
    count += 1
    if count == 13:
        break</code></pre>
<p>Let's consider how break works in <code class="language-python">for...else</code> or <code class="language-python">while...else</code> statements. <code class="language-python">else</code> statements will be executed if no <code class="language-python">break</code> is encountered during the execution of the loop. Look how it works in the examples below!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 5:
        print("It's 5!")
        break
else:
    print('5 was not listed')
# 5 was not listed</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the body of the <code class="language-python">else</code> statement is executed because no <code class="language-python">break</code> was met. Let's change the <code class="language-python">number</code> list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 5:
        print("It's 5!")
        break
else:
    print('5 was not listed')
# It's 5!</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-python">break</code> was met, so the <code class="language-python">print()</code> command after <code class="language-python">else</code> wasn't executed.</p>
<h5 id="continue">Continue</h5>
<p>The <strong>continue</strong> operator is commonly used, too. You can stop the iteration if your condition is true and return to the beginning of the loop (that is, jump to the loop's top and continue execution with the next value). Look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'parrot']
for pet in pets:
    if pet == 'dog':
        continue
    print(pet)</code></pre>
<p>The output will contain all values except the first one ('dog') since it fulfills the condition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">cat
parrot</code></pre>
<p>Thus, the loop just skips one value and goes on running.</p>
<p>One nuance is worth mentioning: the <strong>continue </strong>operator should be used moderately. Sometimes you can shorten the code by simply using an <code class="language-python">if</code> statement with the <strong>reversed </strong>condition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'parrot']
for pet in pets:
    if pet != 'dog':
        print(pet)</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the output will remain the same:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">cat
parrot</code></pre>
<h5 id="pass">Pass</h5>
<p>When no action is required (e.g. some condition is met, you need to take it into account in a loop, but do nothing if that's the case), in Python, you can use <code class="language-python">pass</code> statement which does exactly what you need – nothing. Here the program is just waiting to be manually interrupted:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">while True:
    pass</code></pre>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>To sum up, loop control statements represent a useful tool to alter the way a loop works. You can introduce extra conditions using the <code class="language-python">break</code>, <code class="language-python">continue</code>, and <code class="language-python">pass</code> operators. In addition, they allow you to skip a beforehand selected set of values, terminate an endless loop, or even do nothing. Use them wisely and they'll work wonders.</p>
