  message: "<html>When we are changing the name variable in change_name(), Python\
    \ interpreter considers it to be defined inside the function body (because, as\
    \ per the LEGB rule, it first looks for a variable inside the local scope) and\
    \ therefore local. Local variables canâ€™t be changed outside the function body.\
    \ To change the name variable outside the function body, we must use the keyword\
    \ global.</html>"
