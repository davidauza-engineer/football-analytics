<div class="step-text">
<p>John is writing a program. For some reason, he needs this program to store the name of a current user as well as be able to change it. He wrote a function change_name(), which changes a current username to a new one. However, when he executes the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = "John"

def change_name(new_name):
    name = new_name

change_name("Mary")
print(name)</code></pre>
<p>the output is "John", so the name doesn’t change at all! Help him – write down the line he forgot to include in his function (<strong>only the line, not the whole code</strong>).</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">What can we do to make a variable change not only inside the function body but outside as well?</div>
