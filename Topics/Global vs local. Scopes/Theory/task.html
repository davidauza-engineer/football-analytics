A global variable is defined at the top level of the module and can be accessed from any code block in the program, making it useful for sharing state information or configuration between different functions. Local variables, on the other hand, are only visible within the nearest scope and cannot be accessed from the outside. The keyword 'global' is used to declare a variable as global, meaning it can be accessed and modified from within a function. By default, variables created inside a function are local and cannot be accessed from outside the function.">scope</a></strong> is a part of the program where a certain variable can be reached by its name. The scope is a very important concept in programming because it defines the visibility of a name within the code block.</p>
<h5 id="global-vs-local">Global vs. Local</h5>
<p>When you define a variable, it becomes either <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6322" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'globals' refers to a dictionary that contains the current global symbol table, which is a mapping from variable names to their values in the global namespace. | This means that any variable declared as global can be accessed and modified from within a function. By default, variables created inside a function are local and can only be accessed within that function's scope. Global variables, on the other hand, have a wider scope and can be accessed from any code block in the program. Variable resolution in Python follows the LEGB rule, which stands for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in.">global</a></strong> or <strong>local</strong>. A variable is considered global if it's defined at the top level of a module. This means you can refer to this variable from any part of your program. Global variables can be useful when you need to share state information or configuration between different functions. For example, you can store the name of the current user in a global variable and then use it where needed. This approach makes your code easier to modify: to set a new username, you only need to change a single variable.</p>
<p>Local variables are created when you define them within the body of a function. Their names can only be resolved inside the current function's scope. This localization helps you avoid issues with side effects that may occur when using global variables.</p>
<p>Consider the following example to see the difference between global and local variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">phrase = "Let it be"

def global_printer():
    print(phrase)  # we can use phrase because it's a global variable

global_printer()  # Let it be is printed
print(phrase)  # we can also print it directly

phrase = "Hey Jude"

global_printer()  # Hey Jude is now printed because we changed the value of phrase

def printer():
    local_phrase = "Yesterday"
    print(local_phrase)  # local_phrase is a local variable

printer()  # Yesterday is printed as expected

print(local_phrase)  # NameError is raised</code></pre>
<p>Thus, a global variable can be accessed both from the top level of the module and from within function bodies. On the other hand, a local variable is only visible inside its nearest scope and cannot be accessed from outside that scope.</p>
<h5 id="legb-rule">LEGB rule</h5>
<p>Variable resolution in Python follows the <strong>LEGB rule</strong>. This means that the interpreter looks for a name in the following order:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>Locals</strong>: Variables defined within the function body and not declared global.</p></li><li><p><strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6322" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, enclosing refers to the way a string is defined by surrounding it with a specific type of quotation mark, such as single quotes (') or double quotes (). | Enclosing a string properly is important in Python because it allows the interpreter to distinguish between the string and the code around it. For example, if a string contains a quotation mark that is the same as the one used to enclose the string, it can cause issues in the code. To avoid this, you can use a different type of quotation mark to enclose the string or escape the quotation mark within the string using a backslash (\).">Enclosing</a></strong>: Names in the local scope of all enclosing functions, from inner to outer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Globals</strong>: Names defined at the top level of a module or declared global with the <code class="language-python">global</code> keyword.</p></li><li><p><strong>Built-in</strong>: Any built-in name in Python.</p></li></ol>
<p>Let's consider an example to illustrate the LEGB rule:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "outer local"
    def inner():
        x = "inner local"
        def func():
            x = "func local"
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "func local"</code></pre>
<p>When the <code class="language-python">print()</code> function inside <code class="language-python">func()</code> is called, the interpreter needs to resolve the name <code class="language-python">x</code>. It will first look at the innermost scope and search for a local definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> in the <code class="language-python">func()</code> function. In the case of the code above, the interpreter will successfully find the local <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code> and print its value, <code class="language-python">'func local'</code>. You can <a href="https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=x%20%3D%20%22global%22%0Adef%20outer%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20x%20%3D%20%22outer%20local%22%0A%20%20%20%20def%20inner%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20x%20%3D%20%22inner%20local%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20def%20func%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20x%20%3D%20%22func%20local%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20print%28x%29%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20func%28%29%0A%20%20%20%20inner%28%29%0A%0Aouter%28%29%20%20%23%20%22func%20local%22&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=0&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">visualize this process</a> to see how it works almost in real-time.</p>
<p>But what if there isn't a definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> in <code class="language-python">func()</code>? Then, the interpreter will move outward and look in the <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    x = "outer local"
    def inner():
        x = "inner local"
        def func():
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "inner local"</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the name <code class="language-python">x</code> was resolved in the <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function, since the value <code class="language-python">"inner local"</code> was printed.</p>
<p>If we remove the definition of <code class="language-python">x</code> from the <code class="language-python">inner()</code> function as well and run the code again, the interpreter will continue the search among the <code class="language-python">outer()</code> function's local variables in the same manner. If we keep deleting the lines of code defining <code class="language-python">x</code>, the interpreter will move on to <code class="language-python">outer()</code> locals, then globals, and finally built-in names. If there is no matching built-in name, an error will be raised.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example where the interpreter reaches the global definition of <code class="language-python">x</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = "global"
def outer():
    def inner():
        def func():
            print(x)
        func()
    inner()

outer()  # "global"</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget about LEGB rule if you plan on using enclosing functions.</p>
<h5 id="keywords-nonlocal-and-global">Keywords "nonlocal" and "global"</h5>
<p>We have already mentioned one way to assign a global variable: define it at the top level of a module. However, there is also a special keyword <code class="language-python">global</code> that allows us to declare a variable as global inside a function's body.</p>
<p>You can't change the value of a global variable inside a function without using the <code class="language-python">global</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 1
def print_global():
    print(x)

print_global()  # 1

def modify_global():
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

modify_global()  # UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment, line 8</code></pre>
<p>The error is raised because, to execute <code class="language-python">print(x)</code> on the 8th line, the interpreter tries to resolve <code class="language-python">x</code> and finds it in the <em>local</em> scope â€“ the local <code class="language-python">x</code> is declared on the next line (9th), i.e., after its use on line 8, so the interpreter raises the error. However, even if we removed line 8, the same error would occur. In that case, to execute <code class="language-python">x = x + 1</code>, the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6322" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an interpreter is a layer of software logic that executes your program, going through the code line by line. | It is a part of the standard Python installation package. The interpreter translates the source code into a set of instructions that can be executed directly by your computer's processor. This is in contrast to compiled languages, where a special software called a compiler is used to translate the source code into machine code, which is a set of instructions executed directly by the processor.">interpreter</a> would need to compute the expression <code class="language-python">x + 1</code> and resolve the variable <code class="language-python">x</code> in it. However, <code class="language-python">x</code> is declared in the same line (remember, the interpreter checks the local scope first). Since its value would be needed before it had actually been computed, the interpreter would raise the same error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment</code></pre>
<p>To fix this error, we need to declare <code class="language-python">x</code> as global:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 1
def global_func():
    global x
    print(x)
    x = x + 1

global_func()  # 1
global_func()  # 2
global_func()  # 3</code></pre>
<p>When <code class="language-python">x</code> is global you can increment its value <strong>inside</strong> the function.</p>
<p><code class="language-python">nonlocal</code> keyword lets us assign to variables in the outer (but not global) scope:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def func():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        x = 2
        print("inner:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

def nonlocal_func():
    x = 1
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 2
        print("inner:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)

func()  # inner: 2
        # outer: 1

nonlocal_func()  # inner: 2
                 # outer: 2</code></pre>
<p>Though <code class="language-python">global</code> and <code class="language-python">nonlocal</code> are present in the language, they are not often used in practice, because these keywords make programs less predictable and harder to understand.</p>
<h5 id="why-do-we-need-scopes">Why do we need scopes?</h5>
<p>Python distinguishes between global and local scopes to enhance code organisation. Global scope allows retaining information between function calls, aiding data transfer and communication in complex processes like multithreading. However, if all the declarations were stored in a global scope, the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6322" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a namespace is a container for a set of identifiers (names of variables, functions, classes, etc.) | that are defined in a module or a function. It helps to avoid naming conflicts and allows you to access identifiers using the dot notation. When you import a module, its namespace is added to the current namespace, and you can access its identifiers directly. However, if you want to avoid cluttering the current namespace, you can use the `from ... import ...` statement to import only specific identifiers from a module. Additionally, Python has a concept of scope, which determines the visibility and lifetime of identifiers.">namespace</a> would be extremely clogged up and hard to navigate, which may lead to confusion and bugs. Therefore Python saves you the trouble by allowing you to "isolate" some variables from the rest of the code when you split it into functions.</p>
