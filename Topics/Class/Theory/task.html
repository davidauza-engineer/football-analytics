<p>As you already know, <strong>object-oriented programming (OOP)</strong> is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. Objects interact with each other and that is how the program functions. Objects have states and <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a behavior refers to the actions or operations that can be performed on a data object, determined by its data type. | Just as all dogs share the type dog and can bark, a data object's type determines what operations can be performed on it. For example, a string data type can have methods like indexing, item assignment, and formatting applied to it. These methods are not independent, as they are defined within a class. Data within a class is stored in attributes (variables), which can be either class attributes (shared by all instances of the class) or instance attributes (unique to each instance).">behaviors</a>. Many objects can have similar characteristics and if you need to work with them in your program it may be easier to create a <strong>class </strong>for similar objects. Classes represent the common structure of similar objects: their data and their behavior.</p>
<h5 id="declaring-classes" style="text-align: center;">Declaring classes</h5>
<p>Classes are declared with the keyword <code class="language-python">class</code> and the name of the class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># class syntax
class MyClass:
    var = ...  # some variable

    def do_smt(self):
    # some method
</code></pre>
<p>Generally, a class name starts with a capital letter and it is usually a noun or a noun phrase. The names of the classes follow the <strong>CapWords </strong>convention: meaning that if it's a phrase, all words in the phrase are capitalized and written without underscores between them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># good class name
class MyClass:
    ...

# not so good class name:
class My_class:
    ...</code></pre>
<p>Classes allow you to define the data and the behaviors of similar objects. The behavior is described by <strong>methods. </strong>A method is similar to a function in that it is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a block of code refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Proper indentation is crucial for the block of code to work correctly. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a> that has a name and performs a certain action. Methods, however, are not independent since they are defined within a class. Data within classes are stored in the <strong>attributes</strong> (variables) and there are two kinds of them: <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a class attribute is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. | This means that if a change is made to a class attribute, it will affect all instances of that class. Class attributes are defined within a class, and can be accessed using the dot notation with the name of the class. They are often used to define default values for all objects, store necessary class-specific constants, or keep track of data of all objects. For example, if we have a class called Book, we might use a class attribute to store the publisher of all books in that class.">class attributes</a></strong> and <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an instance attribute is a variable that stores information that is unique to each instance of a class. | Unlike class attributes, which are shared by all instances of a class, instance attributes allow for each object to have its own set of data. For example, if we have a class called Book, we might use instance attributes to store the title, author, and page count for each individual book object. Changing or adding instance attributes only affects the specific object, not the entire class.">instance attributes</a></strong>. The difference between those two will be explained below.</p>
<h5 id="class-attribute" style="text-align: center;">Class attribute</h5>
<p>A class attribute is an attribute shared by all instances of the class. Let's consider the class <strong>Book </strong>as an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Book class
class Book:
    material = "paper"
    cover = "paperback"
    all_books = []</code></pre>
<p>This class has a string variable <code class="language-python">material</code> with the value "paper", a string variable <code class="language-python">cover</code> with the value "paperback" and an empty list as an attribute <code class="language-python">all_books</code>. All those variables are class attributes and they can be accessed using the <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, dot notation, also known as dot syntax, is a way to access attributes or methods of an object. | It is denoted by the . (dot) symbol followed by the attribute or method name. For instance, if you have an object named obj, you can access its attribute attr using the syntax obj.attr. This notation is commonly used in Python to access functions and variables defined in a module. When using dot notation, it is generally a good practice to import only the required functions or variables from a module instead of the entire module.">dot notation</a> </strong>with the name of the class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Book.material  # "paper"
Book.cover  # "paperback"
Book.all_books  # []</code></pre>
<p><strong>Class attributes</strong> are defined within the class but outside of any methods. Their value is the same for all instances of that class so you could consider them as the sort of "default" values for all objects.</p>
<p>As for the <strong>i</strong><strong>nstance variables, </strong>they store the data unique to each object of the class. They are defined within the class methods, notably, within the <code class="language-python">__init__</code> method. In this topic, we'll deal with the class attributes, but don't worry â€“ you'll have plenty of time to learn more about instance attributes.</p>
<h5 id="class-instance" style="text-align: center;">Class instance</h5>
<p>Now, let's create an instance of a <strong>Book </strong>class. For that we would need to execute this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Book instance
my_book = Book()</code></pre>
<p>Here we not only created an instance of a <strong>Book </strong>class but also assigned it to the variable <code class="language-python"><strong>my_book</strong></code>. The syntax of instantiating a class object resembles a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6661" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function call is the act of invoking or using a function or method. | When you call a function, you're essentially asking Python to execute the code inside that function, often passing in some argument to be used within the function's body. This allows for code reuse and modularity, making your program more organized and easier to understand. An argument is a value that will be used inside the function body. To call or invoke a function in your program, simply write its name and add parentheses after it. The values passed into the function during the function call are known as arguments, and they can be used within the function's code.">function call</a>: after the class name, we write parentheses.</p>
<p>Our <code class="language-python">my_book</code> object has access to the contents of the class <strong>Book</strong>: its attributes and methods.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(my_book.material)  # "paper"
print(my_book.cover)  # "paperback"
print(my_book.all_books)  # []</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Well, those were the very basics of classes in Python. Classes represent the common structure of similar objects, their attributes, and their methods. There are class attributes and instance attributes. Class attributes are common to all instances of the class.</p>
<p>All in all, classes are an extremely useful tool that can help you optimize your code and organize the program in a logical and readable way. We hope you'll make use of them!</p>
