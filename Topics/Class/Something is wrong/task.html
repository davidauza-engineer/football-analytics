<p>Imagine you have created the <code class="language-python">Wild_Animal</code> class. It works fine but it can be improved. Look at the first line. How can we change the name in the first line according to PEP8? Print the name (<em>only the name itself</em>) in the box below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Wild_Animal:
    get_food_itself = "yes"
    live_in_nature = "yes"
    live_with_man = "no"
</code></pre>
