<p></p><p>Sometimes, you might need to insert variable values into <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7130" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a text is referred to as a string, which is a sequence of characters used to represent textual information. | Strings can be organized into multiple lines, making them easier to read and understand. In the context of writing a list of names to a file, each name would be followed by a newline character, resulting in each name appearing on a separate line in the file. Additionally, Python uses escape sequences, such as the newline character (n) and carriage return (r), to format and manipulate strings in specific ways.">text</a>. Python has a helpful feature known as <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, string formatting is a helpful feature that allows you to insert variable values into text. | It offers several methods for customizing string formatting, such as the % operator, str.format(), and formatted string literals (f-strings). String formatting is useful when you want to generate the same string with a few differences, such as in greetings. Another tool for string formatting is template strings, which create a string template to fill in later. The string formatting method can also be used to format object(s) into a string using the `str()` method.">string formatting</a> to assist with this. Let's look at what it is and how it helps.</p><p style="text-align: start;">Imagine you need to print a welcome message:</p><pre><code class="language-python">Hi, my name is , I am  years old!</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">Your immediate thought might be to use string concatenation like this:</p><pre><code class="language-python">name = 'John'
age = 20
print('Hi, my name is ' + name + ', I am ' + str(age) + ' years old!')  # an awkward way, considered a bad practice!
# prints 'Hi, my name is John, I am 20 years old!'</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">This strategy works, but it's not perfect. To address such tasks, Python offers you three methods of string formatting.</p><h5 id="the-operator">The % operator</h5><p style="text-align: start;">This built-in operator comes from C-language. Let's use it for our welcome message:</p><pre><code class="language-python">name = 'John'
age = 20
print('Hi, my name is %s, I am %i years old!' % (name, age))  # an old-fashioned way of formatting
# prints 'Hi, my name is John, I am 20 years old!'</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">You see how we created placeholders for the string <code class="language-python">name</code> (<code class="language-python">%s</code>) and for the integer <code class="language-python">age</code> (<code class="language-python">%i</code>) then substituted the variables into the string using the <code class="language-python">%</code> operator.</p><p style="text-align: start;">With the <code class="language-python">%</code> character, we can also control the number of decimal places, for example, reduce their number to 3 or 2:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('%.3f' % (11 / 3))  # 3.667
print('%.2f' % (11 / 3))  # 3.67
# Old-style rounding of decimals</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">However, this approach is quite <strong>old-fashioned </strong>and we do not encourage you to write code like this; in the past, it needed certainty in specifiers, length modifiers, and conversion types. The vast number of extra operators often caused common errors. That's why more user-friendly operators were introduced.</p><h5 id="strformat">str.format()</h5><p style="text-align: start;">One of them is the built-in <code class="language-python">str.format()</code> method. Let's see how it can help us deliver the same welcome message:</p><pre><code class="language-python">name = 'John'
age = 20
print('Hi, my name is {}, I am {} years old!'.format(name, age))  # a more modern formatting method</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">The curly braces in the string are placeholders where the format method inserts the corresponding variables. Notice how we used the <code class="language-python">age</code> variable as it is, without converting it to <code class="language-python">str</code>.</p><p style="text-align: start;">With empty placeholders, variables were substituted <strong>in the same order</strong> they were passed to the <code class="language-python">format()</code> method. But, we can <strong>change the order</strong> and the number of occurrences by specifying the corresponding <strong>position</strong> inside curly braces:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('{0} in the {1} by Frank Sinatra'.format('Strangers', 'Night'))
# prints 'Strangers in the Night by Frank Sinatra'

print('{1} in the {0} by Frank Sinatra'.format('Strangers', 'Night'))
# prints 'Night in the Strangers by Frank Sinatra'

print('{1} in the {0} by Frank Sinatra: {1}'.format('Strangers', 'Night'))
# prints 'Night in the Strangers by Frank Sinatra: Night'

print('{1} in the {0} by Frank Sinatra: {2}'.format('Strangers', 'Night'))
# IndexError</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">Remember, if you passed more variables to the <code class="language-python">format()</code> method than needed, the extra ones would be ignored. On the other hand, if you provided fewer variables, you would get an <code class="language-python">IndexError</code>.</p><p style="text-align: start;">The <code class="language-python">format()</code> method is very flexible, letting you use keywords inside placeholders, like this:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('The {movie} movie at {theatre} was {adjective}!'.format(movie='Star Wars',
                                                        adjective='incredible',
                                                        theatre='BFI IMAX'))</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">This improves your code readability. You can also arrange the keywords in any order, and place them <strong>after </strong>positional arguments:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('The {0} was {adjective}!'.format('Lord of the Rings', adjective='incredible'))
# The Lord of the Rings was incredible!

print('The {0} was {adjective}!'.format(adjective='incredible', 'Lord of the Rings'))
# SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument</code></pre><h5 id="formatted-string-literals">Formatted string literals</h5><p style="text-align: start;">Another method to <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a formatted string, also known as a formatted string literal or f-string, is a way to customize the formatting of strings. | It allows you to insert variable values into text in a brief and clear manner. The f-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 and provide a more convenient and easier-to-read way of formatting strings compared to the older methods such as using the % operator or the str.format() method. Formatted strings are created by prefixing the string with the letter 'f' or 'f' followed by the string. For example, `fThe value of x is {x}`.">format strings</a> in Python is <strong>f-strings</strong>. To create one, you need to put an <code class="language-python">'f'</code> before the string. Look at our welcome message from earlier:</p><pre><code class="language-python">name = 'John'
age = 20
print(f'Hi, my name is {name}, I am {age} years old!')  # another good approach to formatting strings</code></pre><p style="text-align: start;">As you see, f-strings let you use the <code class="language-python">format()</code> method's functionality, but the code turns out to be shorter and cleaner.</p><p style="text-align: start;">You can also <strong>round</strong> decimals with f-strings by specifying the number of decimal places like this:</p><pre><code class="language-python">decimal_number = 291.68
print(f'Decimal number as is: {decimal_number}')
# Decimal number as is: 291.68

print(f'Decimal number rounded to 1 decimal place: {decimal_number:.1f}')  # a clean way of rounding decimals
# Decimal number rounded to 1 decimal place: 291.7</code></pre><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p style="text-align: start;">What are the key points to remember from this topic? Here are two essential takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>The <code class="language-python">str.format()</code> method lets you customize string formatting;</p></li><li><p>Formatted <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by a pair of single or double quotes. | There is no difference between the two, but there are conventions regarding their use. To include any quote in a string, you can use the backslash symbol () before the quote inside the string, which tells Python that the quote symbol that follows it is a part of the string rather than the end or beginning of it. String literals can be used to represent textual information in a program, such as an email of a person or an organization.">string literals</a>, or f-strings, excel in being brief and clear.</p></li></ul><p>Read more on this topic in <a href="https://hyperskill.org/blog/post/working-with-python-strings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Working with Python Strings</a> on Hyperskill Blog.</p>
