# To get input from the user, use the input function, which returns the entered value as a string.
# To convert this string to an integer, use the built-in int function.

andy_height = int(input())

# Now, write a comparison operation to check if Andy's height is greater than Ben's. 
# Remember, the comparison operator should return a boolean value: True or False.

# Finally, print the result of the comparison operation.
print(andy_height > ben_height)
