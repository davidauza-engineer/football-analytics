<ol><li><p><strong>Printing several <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47555" target="_blank" title="In Python, a line is a unit of code that ends with a newline character. | It is typically used to define a single statement or expression, although multiple statements can be placed on the same line using a semicolon. Lines are significant in Python because the interpreter uses them to determine the structure and flow of your code. In the context of output formatting, a line can refer to a single row of text that is printed to the console. Python provides several ways to format and print multi-line output, such as using the print function with multiple arguments or a triple-quoted string. These techniques allow you to create complex, well-formatted output that is easy to read and understand. Finally, in the context of documentation, a line can refer to a single line of a multi-line docstring. Docstrings are used to provide detailed explanations of functions, classes, and other objects in your code. Multi-line docstrings typically consist of a brief one-line summary, followed by a more detailed explanation of the object's functionality.">lines</a>:</strong> The <code class="java">print()</code> function is not just for printing one line â€“ it's a versatile tool for crafting multi-line output in our Python programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Making spaces:</strong> Using the <code class="java">print()</code> function without anything inside the parentheses will leave an empty line.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being Quick:</strong> Triple quotes or <code class="java">\n</code> can be used to print multiple lines with a single <code class="java">print()</code> function call.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using comments:</strong> We can leave little notes in our code using <code class="java">#</code>, kind of like leaving breadcrumbs for others to follow.</p></li></ol>
