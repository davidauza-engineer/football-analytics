<p>There are situations when your program needs to execute some piece of code only if a particular condition is met. It's possible to set that condition in Python and, in this topic, we're gonna learn how!</p>
<h5 id="simple-if-statement" style="text-align: center;">Simple if statement</h5>
<p>So, in Python, a piece of code that should be executed only under some condition should be placed within the body of an <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5953" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an if statement is a conditional expression used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. | The condition is always a boolean expression, which means it can have a value of either true or false. The if statement is followed by a colon and a block of code that will be executed if the condition is met. Proper indentation is crucial for the if statement to work correctly. It is a fundamental tool in programming that allows for more complex logic and decision-making within a program.">if statement</a></strong>. The pattern is the same as in the English language: first comes the keyword <strong><code class="language-python">if</code></strong> , then a condition, and then a list of expressions to execute. The condition is always a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5953" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value, either True or False. | These expressions are often built using boolean operators such as and, or, and not, which allow you to combine and negate other expressions. Python uses short-circuit evaluation for boolean expressions, which means that if the first expression in an and or or operation is sufficient to determine the result, Python won't evaluate the other expressions. Additionally, Python has the concept of truthy and falsy values, where some values (such as empty lists, empty strings, and the number 0) are considered false in a boolean context, while all other values are considered true. The `bool()` function can be used to explicitly convert any value to a boolean.">Boolean expression</a></strong>, that is, its value equals either <code class="language-python">True</code> or <code class="language-python">False</code>. Here is one example of how the code with a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5953" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a conditional expression, also known as an if-else statement, is a type of control flow statement that allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition is true or false. | It consists of an if clause followed by a block of code to be executed if the condition is true, and an else clause followed by a block of code to be executed if the condition is false. Proper indentation is crucial for the if-else statement to work correctly.">conditional expression</a> should look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">biscuits = 17
if biscuits &gt;= 5:
    print("It's time for tea!")</code></pre>
<p>Note that the condition ends with a colon and a new line starts with an <strong>indentation</strong>. Usually, 4 spaces are used to designate each level of indentation. A piece of code in which all lines are on the same level of indentation is called a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5953" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a block of code refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Proper indentation is crucial for the block of code to work correctly. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">block of code</a></strong>. In Python, <em>only </em>indentation is used to separate different blocks of code, hence, only indentation shows which lines of code are supposed to be executed when the <code class="language-python">if</code> statement is satisfied, and which ones should be executed <em>independently </em>of the <code class="language-python">if</code> statement. Check out the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if biscuits &gt;= 5:
    print("It's time for tea!")
    print("What tea do you prefer?")
print("What about some chocolate?")</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the line <code class="language-python">"It's time for tea!"</code>, as well as <code class="language-python">"What tea do you prefer?"</code>, will be printed only if there are 5 or more biscuits. The line <code class="language-python">"What about some chocolate?"</code> will be printed regardless of the number of biscuits.</p>
<p>An <code class="language-python">if</code><strong> </strong>statement is executed only if its condition holds (the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5953" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a boolean value is a special data type that can have only two possible values: True or False. | These values are used to represent the two opposite states of something, such as on or off, yes or no. The values of non-boolean types, such as integers or strings, are called truthy or falsy, depending on whether they are interpreted as true or false. In Python, the following values are evaluated as false: constant defined to be false (None), zero of any numeric type (0, 0.0, 0j), empty sequences and containers ([], (), {}, set()), and empty strings ('', b''). Anything else generally evaluates to true.">Boolean value</a> is <code class="language-python">True</code>), otherwise, it's skipped.</p>
<p>Boolean values basically make it clear whether a piece of code needs to be executed or not. Since comparisons result in <code class="language-python">bool</code>, it's always a good idea to use them as a condition.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">There is one pitfall, though. You should not confuse the comparison operator for equality <code class="language-python">==</code> with the assignment operator <code class="language-python">=</code>. Only the former provides for a proper condition. Try to avoid this common mistake in your code.</div>

<h5 id="nested-if-statement" style="text-align: center;">Nested if statement</h5>
<p>Sometimes a condition happens to be too complicated for a simple <code class="language-python">if</code> statement. In this case,  you can use so-called <strong>nested </strong><code class="language-python">if</code> statements. The more <code class="language-python">if</code> statements are nested, the more complex your code gets, which is usually not a good thing. However, this doesn't mean that you need to avoid nested <code class="language-python">if</code> statements at all costs. Let's take a look at the code below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">rainbow = "red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet"
warm_colors = "red, yellow, orange"
my_color = "orange"

if my_color in rainbow:
    print("Wow, your color is in the rainbow!")
    if my_color in warm_colors:
        print("Oh, by the way, it's a warm color.")</code></pre>
<p>The example above illustrates a nested <code class="language-python">if</code> statement. If the variable <code class="language-python">my_color</code> is a string that contains the name of a color from the rainbow,  we enter the body of the first <code class="language-python">if</code><strong> </strong>statement. First, we print the message and then check if our color belongs to the warm colors. The membership operator <code class="language-python">in</code> simply shows whether <code class="language-python">my_color</code> is a substring of the respective string, <code class="language-python">rainbow</code> or <code class="language-python">warm_colors</code>. Just like arithmetic comparisons, it returns a boolean value.</p>
<p>Here is what we will see in our case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Wow, your color is in the rainbow!
Oh, by the way, it's a warm color.</code></pre>
<p>When it comes to nested <code class="language-python">if</code> statements, proper indentation is crucial, so do not forget to indent each statement that starts with the <code class="language-python">if</code> keyword.</p>
