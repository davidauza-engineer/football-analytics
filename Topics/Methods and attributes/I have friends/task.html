<div class="step-text">
<p>Below you can see the class <code class="java">User</code>.</p>
<p>This class has two methods: <code class="java">__init__</code> and <code class="java">add_friends</code>.</p>
<p>The <code class="java">__init__</code> method does what any <code class="java">__init__</code> does, while <code class="java">add_friends</code> increases the number of friends that the user has by the value of <strong>n</strong>. However, the <code class="java">add_friends</code> method has been defined somewhat incorrectly and right now it doesn't do what it's supposed to do.</p>
<p>Your task is to fix the mistakes in the method.</p>
