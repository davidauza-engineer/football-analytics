<p>Lucy is drawing a poster with English contractions for her students. We will join her English club and help with learning materials.</p>
<p>Print the following strings with contractions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">I am = I'm
I have = I've
I will = I'll
I had / would = I'd</code></pre>
<p>Each string should be on a new line. This will be easy if you use quotes wisely.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
