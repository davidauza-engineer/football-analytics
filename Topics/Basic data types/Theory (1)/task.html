<p>Alright, let's summarize what we've covered in this module — the ABCs of Python's basic <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47516" target="_blank" title="In Python, a data type is a classification of data that determines how it is stored in memory, what operations can be performed on it, and how those operations are executed. | It is similar to a biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects. For example, all dogs you've seen have the type dog, but each is an individual object. When it comes to Python, data types include basic data types such as strings, numerical types, and printing types. When you assign a value to a variable, Python creates a new object, places the value inside the object, and then creates a reference from the variable name to the object.">data types</a>:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>Strings</strong> (str): Think of these as the MVPs for handling text. They're your go-to when dealing with words and sentences. Plus, you can wrap them up in either single or double quotes for extra flexibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integers</strong> (int): These are the plain ol' whole numbers, no decimal points involved. Whether it's -3, 0, or 42, they're your trusty companions for counting and beyond.</p></li><li><p><strong>Floats</strong> (float): Now, these are the numbers with a bit of flair—they come with a decimal point. From 3.14 to -0.5, floats are your go-to for those precise measurements.</p></li></ol>
<p style="text-align: start">And hey, let's not forget about our buddy, the <code class="java">type()</code> function. This little gem helps us figure out what type of data we're dealing with at any given moment.</p>
