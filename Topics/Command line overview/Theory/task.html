For example, if you want to open a file, you have to tell the Operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS) about it. There are two ways of interacting with the OS: one is text-based, the other is visual based. Both are important. These two methods are the command-line interface and the graphical user interface.</p><h5 id="what-is-the-command-line">What is the command line?</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262937/1080/b6fe73fbfc39c6196d19de518a2e0a65.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262937/1080/b6fe73fbfc39c6196d19de518a2e0a65.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p>The <strong>command-line interface </strong>or<strong> CLI </strong>is a way to interact with an OS via text commands. On the other hand, the <strong>graphical user interface</strong> or <strong>GUI</strong> provides an interface with many icons and menus. Here, you give commands to the operating system by clicking on these icons or menu items. </p><p>In the past, command-line interfaces were the only means of interacting with a computer. But why use it now, when you have a simple, familiar graphical interface? Well, generally command-line interfaces are much more flexible and have more options. For example, you can combine commands to create a new one, while you cannot do that via a graphical interface. Some software can even have only a command-line interface, thus requiring its user to know command line basics.</p><p>Besides, programs executable by the command-line interface can be written in a command language. They are called <strong>shell scripts</strong> on UNIX and UNIX-like systems such as GNU/Linux and macOS, and <strong>batch files</strong> on Windows.</p><p>All operating systems have command-line interfaces. Applications may have it as well. Also, modern programming languages provide an interactive command-line mode, in which you execute code line by line.</p><h5 id="accessing-command-line-interpreter">Accessing command-line interpreter</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262939/1080/951338bcb0bd82fc7acdaa95f8066cd6.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262939/1080/951338bcb0bd82fc7acdaa95f8066cd6.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p>Usually, you don't have to go to the location of the <strong>command-line interpreter </strong>or<strong> terminal</strong> to open it. You can open it by simply searching <em>cmd</em> in Windows and <em>terminal</em> in Linux distributions. </p><p>If you feel more like an explorer and want to find the location on your own, then try the following paths: </p><ul><li><p>For Windows 10 or 8 at <em>Start→Windows System→Command Prompt</em>.</p></li><li><p>For Windows 7, Vista or XP at <em>Start→All Programs→Accessories→Command Prompt</em>.</p></li><li><p>For macOS at <em>Applications→Utilities→Other→Terminal</em>. Some Mac users prefer iTerm2, a replacement for Terminal, because it is slightly more user-friendly. You can find the details on the <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">iTerm official website</a> and install it on your computer.</p></li><li><p>For Linux: it depends on your system, but usually, the CLI is located at <em>Applications→Accessories→Terminal</em> or at <em>Applications→System→Terminal</em>. If you don't find it here, just google how to access the command line on your system.</p></li></ul><p>When you open it, you'll see a black (or white) window. If everything is okay, you'll see the <strong>command prompt</strong> where you'll be typing your command – an indicator that your computer is ready to accept commands. For Windows, the command prompt ends with <code class="language-bash">&gt;</code>, while for Linux it's <code class="language-bash">$</code>, and for Mac OS it's <code class="language-bash">$</code>. To execute a command, type it and then press Enter.</p><h5 id="learning-commands">Learning commands</h5><p><video controls="" src="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262954/1080/02e0ded4c56a72aaf8f49ff9ce88fd01.mp4"> Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can <a href="https://stepikvideo.blob.core.windows.net/video/262954/1080/02e0ded4c56a72aaf8f49ff9ce88fd01.mp4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download it</a> and watch it with your favorite video player! </video></p><p>It's time to learn some important commands. Let's open the command-line interpreter and type some commands. When you open it, you will see something similar to the below text. </p><pre><code class="language-bash">C:\Users\name&gt;</code></pre><p>It means that you are in this directory and you can work in the CLI. Now let's try to use it.</p><p>Imagine you just woke up on the floor in a room unfamiliar to you. In fact, everything is unfamiliar to you, you don't remember anything, not even your name. There's only a computer with the open terminal and this guide, so you decide that it might be helpful to figure something out. So, now you will type your command next to this path. </p><p>First, type <code class="language-bash">whoami</code> and press <em>Enter</em>. Unfortunately, it won't provide you with a deep and satisfying answer about who you really are, but you will see something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">desktop-qd7c3ju\shanika</code></pre><p>Good, now you know your name, an imaginary one, at least. As you could already guess, the <code class="language-bash">whoami</code> command just returns the username you used on your machine. That's why you see the above output. </p><p>Next, type <code class="language-bash">dir</code> if you use Windows or <code class="language-bash">ls</code> if you use Linux or macOS and press <em>Enter</em>. Both of these commands return the list of non-hidden files and folders in your current directory. To show the list including hidden files and folders, just add an option <code class="language-bash">-a</code>, which stands for <em>all</em>. The <code class="language-bash">ls</code> command is one of the most widely used ones by developers, especially when they work on servers.</p><p>If you have Windows, you will see something similar to the image below.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/480x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/960x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1440x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/800x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1600x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2400x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1100x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/-/stretch/off/-/resize/3000x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="the output of the dir command" height="345" src="https://ucarecdn.com/7d86c81a-7896-42ed-8c88-1fe7e6e5aa01/" width="425"/></picture></p><p>There's no file that is helpful for your situation. Alas!</p><p>Isn't there a command to escape? Yes, there's one.

It is still one of the quickest ways to get your job done. Especially if you are going to be a developer, it is very important to have good knowledge of what commands are available to you.</p><p>In this topic, we introduced the command-line interface: what it is, where it can be found, and how it can be used. We tried several commands as well: <code class="language-bash">whoami</code>, <code class="language-bash">dir</code> or <code class="language-bash">ls</code>,  and <code class="language-bash">exit</code>. Later, we will learn CLI commands in detail, but now let's practice for a while! </p>
