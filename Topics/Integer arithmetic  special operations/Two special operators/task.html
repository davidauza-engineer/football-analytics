<p>Welcome back to our exploration of integer arithmetic in Python! Now that you've mastered the basics like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and integer division, let's dive into more intriguing territory.</p><p>In today's lesson, we'll discuss two additional operators: <strong>exponentiation</strong> and <strong>modulo</strong>. But before we dive in, let's check if you can handle exponentiation without Python. Here's a captivating puzzle to tickle your brain:</p><p>Picture a 1-meter-tall plant in your garden. This plant has a special qualityâ€”it doubles in height each day. After four days of this unique growth pattern, how tall will our extraordinary plant be? ðŸŒ±ðŸ’¡</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p><strong>Hint: </strong>The tree shows an exponential growth. It's final height will be <span class="math-tex">\(\text{(Initial height)}\times {\text{2}}^{\text{(Number of Days)}}\)</span>.</p></div>
