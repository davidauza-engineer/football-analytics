<p>Here is a practice exercise for your new Python lesson.</p><p>Assume you're a student tackling a geometry problem: finding the volume of a cube. Remembering your lessons, you recall that the volume of a cube can be calculated using a simple formula: <span class="math-tex">\(\text{Volume} = \text{(side length)}^3\)</span>.</p><p>Armed with a ruler, you measure one side, finding it to be <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> units long. Your task is to apply this formula to find the volume of the cube and print it to the screen by writing a Python program.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
