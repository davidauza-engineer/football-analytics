<p>Let's spice things up a bit! You can blend together the arithmetic operations we've covered to craft more complex expressions. Keep in mind the order of precedence for these operators. Here's the hierarchy:</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Parentheses &gt; Exponentiation &gt; Multiplication/Division/Integer Division/Modulo &gt; Addition/Subtraction</p></div><p>What's with the <strong>parentheses ()</strong> reigning supreme at the top? Good observation! While not an operation itself, <strong>parentheses serve to clarify the order of execution.</strong> Anything within parentheses gets calculated before any operations outside. They're like the directors calling the shots on which operations to execute first. Pretty dominating, huh?</p><p>Let's wrap up our discussion with an exercise: Can you guess the output of the following Python code?</p><pre><code class="language-python">print((5 + 3) - 6**2 / 3)</code></pre>
