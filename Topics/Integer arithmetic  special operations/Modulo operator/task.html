<p>In the last step, you tackled the remainder calculation with three operators. But Python is all about simplicity. The modulo operator (<span class="math-tex">\(\%\)</span>) â€”it's here to streamline your life. With <strong>Python's modulo operator (<span class="math-tex">\(\%\)</span>), you can easily find the remainder of any division.</strong></p><p>One of its handy uses is checking whether a number is even or odd. For instance:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(25 % 2)</code></pre><p>The output is <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>, which is the remainder when we divide <span class="math-tex">\(25\)</span> by <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>, indicating that <span class="math-tex">\(25\)</span> is an odd number.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(20 % 2)</code></pre><p>This time, the output is <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span> because <span class="math-tex">\(20\)</span> is an even number. So there is no remainder.</p><p>Now, it's your turn. Please write the output of the following code in the box below:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(62 % 12)</code></pre>
