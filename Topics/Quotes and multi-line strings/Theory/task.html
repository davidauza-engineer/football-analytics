<p>You are already familiar with strings, which are extremely common and useful in programming. Let's take a look at some features of Python strings related to quotes and multi-line strings.</p>
<h5 id="quotes" style="text-align: center;">Quotes</h5>
<p>As you know, a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5814" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by a pair of single or double quotes. | There is no difference between the two, but there are conventions regarding their use. To include any quote in a string, you can use the backslash symbol () before the quote inside the string, which tells Python that the quote symbol that follows it is a part of the string rather than the end or beginning of it. String literals can be used to represent textual information in a program, such as an email of a person or an organization.">string literal</a> is surrounded by a pair of <strong>single</strong> or <strong>double quotes</strong>. There is basically no difference between the two, but there are some common conventions concerning their use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use double quotes if your string contains single quotes, for example, <code class="language-python">"You're doing great!"</code>.</li>
<li>Use single quotes if your string contains double quotes, for example, <code class="language-python">'Have you read "Hamlet"?'</code>.</li>
<li>Do not mix two styles in one literal! For example, something like <code class="language-python">"string!'</code> is not correct.</li>
<li>Most importantly, be<strong> </strong>consistent in your use!</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a way to include any quotes in your string, regardless of the style of the outer quotes, and that is to use the <strong>backslash symbol </strong>(<code class="language-python">\</code>) before the quotes inside of the string. The backslash will basically tell Python that the quote symbol that follows it is a part of the string rather than its end or beginning. It is called <strong>escaping</strong>, and you'll learn about it in detail in the next topics. </p>
<p>In the examples below, both ways of writing strings are correct and will produce the same result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># example 1
print("You're doing great!")
print('You\'re doing great!')
# example 2
print("Have you read \"Hamlet\"?")
print('Have you read "Hamlet"?')
</code></pre>
<p>However, it's considered best practice to avoid backslashes inside the strings â€“ even though it works. You'll learn more about the style conventions in following topics.</p>
<h5 id="multiline-strings" style="text-align: center;">Multiline strings</h5>
<p>Strings can represent a long text, a single character, or even no characters, like in the case of an empty string. One thing has so far been true about all of them: all our strings were single line, no matter how long they were. However, you can also write <strong>multi-line</strong> strings in Python! To do that, you need to use <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5814" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a triple quote is a set of three quotes (either single or double) used to denote a multi-line string. | Unlike a single or double quote, which are used for single-line strings, triple quotes allow for the creation of strings that span multiple lines. They are often used for documentation strings (docstrings) in Python, which provide a brief description of a module, function, or class. Triple quotes can be placed on separate lines, with the detailed description starting at the same position as the first quote of the first docstring line.">triple quotes</a></strong> on each side of the string literal. Again, the choice of single or double quotes is up to you as both work fine in Python.</p>
<p>Multi-line string in double quotes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("""This
is
a
multi-line
string""")</code></pre>
<p>Multi-line string in single quotes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print('''This
is
a
multi-line
string''')</code></pre>
<p>Both examples print the same result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">This
is
a
multi-line
string</code></pre>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>In this topic, we've covered some basic information about using quotes in strings and saw how to write multi-line strings. This is by far not all you can do with strings in Python: there is a lot more to learn and, very importantly, to practice!</p>
