<div class="step-text">
<p>Assume you have a database which contains information about products including columns 'price', 'available_quantity' and 'manufacturer'. The NULL value represents unknown data. Using WHERE clause in SQL, how can you select rows where the 'available_quantity' is more than 50 and the 'manufacturer' is known (that is, not NULL)?</p>
