<p>In practice, data is often stored in the form of a table, for example, an Excel spreadsheet, a CSV file, or an SQL database. Imagine that you need to analyze this tabular data and get some useful insights from it. Let's think of the task you will need to perform.</p><p>First, you will need to load data from different formats preserving its tabular structure and probably join several tables together. Then, to perform the actual data analysis, you will definitely want to access different columns, rows, and cells of the tables, compute some overall statistics, create pivot tables and maybe even make basic plots. Is there a tool in Python that combines all these functionalities? The answer is yes!</p><p>This topic will introduce you to <code class="language-bash">pandas</code>, a powerful open-source library for data manipulation and analysis. You will learn how to install the library and get an idea of its main functionality.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/480x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/960x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1440x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/800x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1600x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2400x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1100x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/-/stretch/off/-/resize/3000x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="The pandas package logo" height="122" src="https://ucarecdn.com/d2f83723-9879-4676-8938-d923233433fd/" width="301"/></picture></p><h5 id="installing-pandas">Installing pandas</h5><p><code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is not included in the standard Python library, so you might need to install it separately, for example, using <code class="language-bash">pip</code>. Type the following in your command line:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">pip install pandas</code></pre><p>Note that <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is built on top of <code class="language-bash">NumPy</code> which will be installed as well. Besides, there are many optional dependencies. For instance, if you want to use <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> data visualization functionality, you need to install <code class="language-bash">matplotlib</code>, a plotting library in Python. You can install those libraries using <code class="language-bash">pip</code> as well.</p><p>Once the installation is complete, you will be able to import it in your code. Since <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is quite a long name, it is commonly abbreviated and imported as <code class="language-bash">pd</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-python">import pandas as pd</code></pre><p> </p><p>Note that new versions of pandas are released once in a while, with new functionalities and fixed bugs. So it would be a good idea to keep an eye on the updates. You can easily upgrade the version of pandas on your machine with this command: <code class="language-bash">pip install --upgrade pandas</code>.</p><p> </p><h5 id="inside-pandas">Inside pandas</h5><p>As stated in its guidelines, <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> aims to become "the most powerful and flexible open-source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language".</p><p>The name <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is derived from <strong>'panel data'</strong>, a term that is used in statistics and econometrics to refer to data sets containing observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. This library will be helpful if you are working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases. Apart from that, <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> offers great support for time series and provides extensive functionality for working with dates, times, and time-indexed data.</p><p>With the help of <code class="language-bash">pandas</code>, one can easily perform the most typical data processing steps. In particular, the package makes it convenient to load and save data, as it supports out-of-the-box integration with many commonly-used tabular formats such as <code class="language-bash">.csv</code>, <code class="language-bash">.xlsx</code>, as well as SQL databases.</p><p>Let's look at what else we can get from pandas!</p><ul><li><p>Intuitive merging and joining of data sets allow for easily combining data from different sources, while flexible reshaping tools help construct statistical data summaries.</p></li><li><p>With <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> we can edit, sort, reshape and explore tabular data. For example, you could get all unique values from a column just with one command.</p></li><li><p>Missing values in the data are represented as NaN and can be easily handled, for example, they can be replaced by some value, using built-in functionality.</p></li><li><p>If you install <code class="language-bash">matplotlib</code>, a Python plotting library, you can use the <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> built-in plotting functionality to make a basic plot from your data to better understand it.</p></li><li><p>You can get basic statistical information about your data with literally one line of code. </p></li><li><p>It can be integrated with other libraries for machine learning, such as <code class="language-bash">sklearn</code>.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is open-source software, which makes it very popular in both academic and commercial domains. To discover the full potential of <code class="language-bash">pandas</code>, take a look <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">at the documentation</a>.</p><h5 id="data-structures-in-pandas">Data structures in pandas</h5><p>The two data structures of <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> are <code class="language-bash">Series</code> (1D) and <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> (2D). You will get more familiar with them in the dedicated topics â€” we'll just provide an overview. </p><p><code class="language-bash">Series</code> is a one-dimensional array that stores elements of the same data type.</p><p>Each element stored in a <code class="language-bash">Series</code> is associated with a label called <strong>index</strong>. By default, this index is just a sequence (0, 1, 2, ...) . However, you can use any custom values. For example, when analyzing time series, timestamps are typically set as indexes.</p><p>Indexes, as well as automatic and explicit data alignment based on them, are the core of <code class="language-bash">pandas</code>.</p><p><code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code>, in turn, is a two-dimensional data structure that is used to represent tabular data with columns of potentially different data types. You can see <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> as a table, each column of which is a <code class="language-bash">Series</code> object. In other words, <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> is a container for <code class="language-bash">Series</code>, while <code class="language-bash">Series</code> is a container for scalars.</p><p>This is illustrated with the example below. The three <code class="language-bash">Series</code> objects store names, surnames, and ages of students respectively, while the <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> combines this information in a single table. </p><p><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/480x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/960x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1440x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/800x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1600x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2400x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1100x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/-/stretch/off/-/resize/3000x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="An illustration of how 3 Series objects(First name, Family name, and Age) form a DataFrame with 3 corresponding columns" height="931" src="https://ucarecdn.com/97603329-603f-4230-981a-1f1f178691ec/" width="1773"/></picture></p><p> </p><p>Note that each row in the <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> is also associated with an index (which can be numeric or a label-based). It is worth mentioning that even though <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> is a 2D data structure, one can still use it to represent higher-dimensional data by using the so-called <strong>multi-index</strong>, that is, assigning several indexes, or labels, to each row.</p><p>Tables represented as <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> slightly differ from spreadsheets to optimize computations. <code class="language-bash">Series</code> (= columns of a <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code>) can store data of <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html#dtypes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">one type only</a> to perform operations on them faster. <code class="language-bash">Series</code> uses NumPy arrays (or their extensions) under the hood, and the same data type limitation is imposed due to optimization.</p><details><summary>A note on the usage of the 'same data type'</summary><div><p>When talking about storing the data of the same data type, we are not referring to the fundamental Python data types (such as <code class="language-bash">str</code> or <code class="language-bash">int</code>). A <code class="language-bash">Series</code> object can store both the <code class="language-bash">str</code> and the <code class="language-bash">int</code>, but a <code class="language-bash">Series</code> can only have a single data type. In this case of <code class="language-bash">str</code> and <code class="language-bash">int</code> in a single <code class="language-bash">Series</code>, it will be cast to the <code class="language-bash">object</code> data type.

This helps <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> efficiently manage memory usage for <code class="language-bash">Series</code>. Specifically:</p><ol><li><p>Adding values: it is not possible to directly add values to an existing <code class="language-bash">Series</code> object. Instead, when you perform an operation that appears to add values to a <code class="language-bash">Series</code>, <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> creates a new <code class="language-bash">Series</code> object with the combined values from the original <code class="language-bash">Series</code> and the added values.</p></li><li><p>Removing values: by default, removing values from a <code class="language-bash">Series</code> also creates a new <code class="language-bash">Series</code> object that contains only the remaining values. However, pandas provides an option to modify the existing <code class="language-bash">Series</code> object in-place when removing values, although this still involves creating a copy of the original object internally.</p></li></ol><p>In both cases of adding or removing values, even when modifying the <code class="language-bash">Series</code> in-place, <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> generates a copy of the original object to ensure that the original data remains unchanged. This copy operation is performed efficiently and helps maintain the immutability of <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> objects.</p><p>Since <code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is designed to preserve immutability, it is generally not recommended to perform operations in place, because modifying the original object instead of creating a new object might lead to unexpected results and issues with debugging the code.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Here is what you should know about <code class="language-bash">pandas</code>:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is a flexible tool for data analysis.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-bash">pandas</code> is a perfect tool to work with heterogeneous data.</p></li><li><p>There are two data structures in <code class="language-bash">pandas</code>: <code class="language-bash">Series</code> (1D) and <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> (2D).</p></li><li><p><code class="language-bash">Series</code> stores values of the same data type, while columns in a <code class="language-bash">DataFrame</code> can be of different types.</p></li></ul><p>Read more on this topic in <a href="https://hyperskill.org/blog/post/exploring-pandas-library-for-python" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Exploring Pandas Library for Python</a> on Hyperskill Blog.</p>
