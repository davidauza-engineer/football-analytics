<p>Let's move forward to the next set of operations. We know you may have guessed the symbols for multiplication and division. To be thorough, here are examples to illustrate multiplication and division:</p><pre><code class="language-python">a = 10 
b = 2 
product = a * b 
division = a / b
print(product)
print(division)</code></pre><p>In this context, <strong>the <span class="math-tex">\(*\)</span> symbol signifies multiplication, and <span class="math-tex">\(/\)</span> denotes division</strong>.</p><p>Now, let's try an exercise.</p><p>Suppose we have stored the length and width of a rectangle in variables named <code class="language-python">length</code> and <code class="language-python">width</code>. Write a line of code to print the area of the rectangle.</p><p>Just calculate and print the area. The <code class="language-python">length</code> and <code class="language-python">width</code> variables are already defined.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
