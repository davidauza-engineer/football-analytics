<p>Alright, let's dive into addition and subtraction in Python! With the <strong>"+" symbol, you can add values</strong> effortlessly, while the <strong>"-" symbol gracefully subtracts them</strong>. Check out this example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(5 + 3) 
print(5 - 3)</code></pre><p>The program will display:</p><pre><code class="language-python">8

print(a + b) 
print(a - b)</code></pre><p>It's your turn to guess the output of the code above. Please select the correct output:</p>
