<p>Let's tackle this question now: how can we obtain an integer by dividing two numbers?</p><p>The answer is the <strong>integer division</strong> (also known as floor division and denoted by <span class="math-tex">\(//\)</span>) in Python. While regular division (<span class="math-tex">\(/\)</span>) yields a floating-point number, <strong>integer division produces an integer value</strong> by discarding the decimal part. Here's a quick example to illustrate the contrast:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(7 / 2)
print(7 // 2)</code></pre><p>The first line will print <span class="math-tex">\(3.5\)</span> but the second line will print only the integer part, which is <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span>.</p><p>Ready for a test? Please match the following expressions with the appropriate outputs:</p>
