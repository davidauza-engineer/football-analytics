<p>Let's summarize our lesson:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Arithmetic Operations:</strong> Python provides basic <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47564" target="_blank" title="In Python, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed on numerical values. | Python supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There is a difference between division and integer division. The first produces a floating-point number, while the second one produces an integer value, ignoring the decimal part. Python raises an error if you try to divide by zero. Arithmetic operations can be combined to write more complex expressions. For instance, subtraction or division would be done similarly. The main principle with these methods is to understand what a particular operation means for your object and then define the corresponding method. Python also has a number of methods for augmented assignment, which are a combination of standard arithmetic operations with the assignment. Their names are pretty self-explanatory, such as += or -=. For complex numbers, you can define the method for the += operator, which would work by adding the right operand to the current value of the left operand. Additionally, you can compare objects using comparison operators such as &lt;, &gt;, ==, etc.">arithmetic operations</a> like addition (<span class="math-tex">\(+\)</span>), subtraction (<span class="math-tex">\(-\)</span>), multiplication (<span class="math-tex">\(*\)</span>), and division (<span class="math-tex">\(/\)</span>). These operations are essential for various programming tasks and real-life scenarios.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integer division:</strong> In Python, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47564" target="_blank" title="In Python, integer division refers to the division operation performed on integers, where the result is also an integer obtained by discarding the fractional part. | This is different from floating-point division, which returns a floating-point number as the result. Integer division is typically performed using the integer division operator (//), which returns the quotient of the division of the first operand by the second operand. It's important to note that in Python, division by zero always raises an error, but in some other programming languages, you can get away with this if at least one of the operands is a real number.">integer division</a> can be performed using the <code class="java">//</code> operator, which returns the quotient as an integer by discarding the fractional part.</p></li></ul>
<p>With a solid understanding of these principles, you'll be equipped to tackle a wide range of challenges in Python programming!</p>
<p>But wait, there's more. In the upcoming lesson, you'll learn about two additional important operators in Python.</p>
