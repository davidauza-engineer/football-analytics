<p>Mary has a <code class="java">datatable.csv</code> file with some calculations. She keeps this file in <code class="java">/my_project</code> directory and makes some changes to it from time to time. But she also wants the file to be accessed from the <code class="java">root</code> directory with all the changes she already made in the first directory. What should Mary do?<br/>
