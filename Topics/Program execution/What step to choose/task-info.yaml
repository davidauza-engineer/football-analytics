  message: "<html>You're right! You've already written the code. Python is an interpreted\
    \ language, however, they also include a compilation step, but the compiler turns\
    \ the source code into the byte code first, an intermediate language, which later\
    \ is executed by the Python Virtual Machine right away without converting the\
    \ byte code into the machine code, while with compiled languages, a compiler translates\
    \ the source code into the machine code which is directly executed by a processor.</html>"
