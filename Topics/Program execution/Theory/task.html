<p>What does it mean to write a program in Python? From the programmer's point of view, it implies writing certain instructions in a file and then executing it in Python. We can simply create a<strong> </strong><em>.txt </em>file with the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
<p>And then execute it from the command line in the following way (suppose, we named it <em>example.txt</em>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python example.txt</code></pre>
<p>You may know that all Python files are supposed to have a <em>.py </em>extension, but we can write the code in a <em>.txt </em>file as well. Usually, programmers don't use text editors for programming, they use<strong> </strong><strong>IDE</strong>s (Integrated Development Environment), a special program designed for software development. However, one thing remains â€” the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a source code is a set of instructions written in a high-level programming language that a human can read and understand. | When it comes to Python, the source code is typically written in a .py file. During the execution of a Python program, the source code goes through a compilation step where it is turned into an intermediate language called bytecode. The bytecode is a lower level, platform-independent, and more efficient version of the source code. This bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which is a part of the standard Python installation package.">source code</a> is just a set of specific instructions.</p>
<p>It's not all that simple. You may have heard that there are <strong>interpreted</strong> and <strong>compiled </strong>programming languages. Maybe you've also heard that Python is an interpreted language. But do you know what that means?</p>
<h5 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h5>
<p>The process of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, program execution refers to the process of running a Python program, which involves interpretation or compilation of the code. | During program execution, Python's interpreter reads the code, translates it into machine-readable format, and executes it line by line. If any errors or exceptions occur during this process, the program will crash while attempting to execute the problematic line. Program execution speed is an essential aspect of software development, and Python is known for its fast code creation speed, although it may be slower than languages like Java or C++. However, for many applications, the slower execution speed is acceptable, as it allows for quicker release of new features. In cases where improving application speed is crucial, profilers can be used to measure the runtime of specific code and identify the slowest-running parts.">program execution</a> may seem something like this to you:</p>

<p>The <strong>interpretation </strong>part, in fact, fits into the middle part of this scheme:</p>

<p>The majority of Python programmers just stop inquiring further from this point. Let's try to explain what the interpretation means in this case.</p>
<p>During the interpretation part, the software goes through your program and executes the code, line by line. This software is called an <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an interpreter is a layer of software logic that executes your program, going through the code line by line. | It is a part of the standard Python installation package. The interpreter translates the source code into a set of instructions that can be executed directly by your computer's processor. This is in contrast to compiled languages, where a special software called a compiler is used to translate the source code into machine code, which is a set of instructions executed directly by the processor.">interpreter</a></strong>. It is a part of the standard Python installation package. So, an interpreter is a layer of software logic between your source code and your hardware.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">An interpreter can be written in any programming language. The default Python interpreter is written in C, it is called CPython. This is what we install from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official Python website</a>.</div>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="interpreted-or-compiled">Interpreted or compiled?</h5>
<p>To understand what is under the hood of Python, let's find out what lies behind the concept of interpreted and compiled languages. </p>
<p>Before we start, let's discuss an easy example. Imagine you have a wonderful apple pie recipe that you want to bake, but it's written in French and you don't know it. There are two ways for you to deal with it. The first one is if someone had already translated the recipe text into English. At that moment, you could read the English text and bake an apple pie. Consider this translated recipe as the <strong>compiled </strong>version. The second way is if you have a friend who knows French. When you are ready to bake a pie, your friend stands nearby and translates the recipe into English line by line. In this case, your friend is an interpreter for the <strong>interpreted </strong>version of the recipe.</p>
<p>With compiled languages, when a programmer wants to run a source code, they need to use a <strong>compiler </strong>first. It is the special software that translates the source code into a special language. This language is called the <strong>machine code</strong>. It is a set of instructions executed directly by your processor. The problem is that different types of computers operate with different machine codes, so the source code compiled in Windows may not work on a Mac.</p>
<p>Interpreted languages also include a compilation step, but the compiler turns your source code into the so-called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, byte code is a platform-independent, intermediate language that is more detailed and more efficient than the source code. | It is generated by the compiler as an intermediate step before the code is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The byte code is saved in a .pyc file, and if the source code has not been modified since the last compilation, Python will load the existing .pyc file, thereby bypassing the compilation step. This process makes Python programs more efficient and portable, as the same byte code can be executed on different types of computers.">byte code</a></strong>, an intermediate language. The byte code is a lower level<strong> </strong>(more detailed), platform-independent, and more efficient<strong> </strong>version of the source code. We need a special abstract computer (the Python Virtual Machine in our case, but more on that later!) to execute this code.</p>
<p>In fact, the interpretation step consists of three phases:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="Interpretation phases" height="170" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e306fb18-203e-4805-962d-9e1a8469c070/" width="758"/></picture></p>
<p>Byte code is saved as a <em>.pyc</em> file after the compilation. If the source code of the program has not been changed since the last compilation, Python will load the existing <em>.pyc </em>file, bypassing the compilation step.</p>
<p>Below you can see the readable byte code. The second column contains the instructions in the order of their execution. If something is unclear, it's OK. You don't have to know the byte code inside out to write programs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (print)
            2 LOAD_CONST               0 ('Hello, World!')
            4 CALL_FUNCTION            1
            6 RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<h5 id="python-virtual-machine">Python Virtual Machine</h5>
<p>The byte code is supplied to the PVM (Python Virtual Machine) after the compilation. It may sound quite impressive, but in fact, it is nothing more than a big piece of code that iterates through the byte code instructions, which were received from a compiler, and executes them one by one. It is an internal part of the Python system and you don't need to install it as a separate program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">PVM in CPython does not convert the byte code into the machine code. It can execute it right away.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>This complexity is hidden from a programmer for a reason. The interpretation is fully automated, and you won't need to think about it at all. Remember that Python programmers simply write the code and run the files, Python does everything else.</p>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>Python is an interpreted language. It compiles the source code to the byte code before the execution. Executing a Python program implies both compilation and<strong> </strong>interpretation.</p>
<p>When your program is turned into the byte code, it's executed<strong> </strong>line by line by the PVM. That's why Python is slower than compiled languages such as C++ or C.</p>
