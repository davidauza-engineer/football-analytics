<p>Write a program that reads numbers until a user enters <span class="math-tex">\(55\)</span>. Once <u><em><span class="math-tex">\(55\)</span></em></u><em> </em>is entered, stop reading the input and ignore the numbers entered afterward (numbers entered before <u><em><span class="math-tex">\(55\)</span></em></u>, <em>regardless of whether they are greater or less than</em> <span class="math-tex">\(55\)</span>, should be counted), print out how many numbers have been entered before <u><em><span class="math-tex">\(55\)</span></em></u>, their total sum, and average (round the resulting average this way: <code class="java">round(average)</code>). Do <strong>NOT</strong> include <em><u><span class="math-tex">\(55\)</span></u></em> in your calculations. Print each resulting value on a new line in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many numbers were given until 55</li>
<li>their sum</li>
<li>their average: sum / the number of given numbers</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip:</b> There are several ways to solve the problem, feel free to choose the one you like. However, the easiest one would be to use two variables  â€“ one to count incoming numbers (assign it to 0 and increase its value each time the incoming number is not 55) and one to sum them up on the fly (once again, start with 0 and add each incoming number not equal to 55 to it). This way, you won't need any additional tools.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>55<br>17<br>16<br>15<br>14<br>13</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">18<br>153<br>8</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
