<p>Setting conditions is a pretty popular and useful tool in programming. However, sometimes just to check if a condition is true or not might not be enough. Let's say, you don't want a piece of code to execute if your condition is false, but, if that's the case, there is another piece of code you do want to execute. For situations like this Python has another powerful tool about which we're gonna learn in this topic! </p>

The values of non-boolean types, such as integers or strings, are called truthy or falsy, depending on whether they are interpreted as true or false.

Anything else generally evaluates to true.">Boolean value</a> is <code class="language-python">False</code>). Since an else statement is an alternative for an if statement, only one block of code can be executed. Also,  <code class="language-python">else</code> doesn't require any condition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if today == "holiday":
    print("Lucky you!")
else:
    print("Keep your chin up, then.")</code></pre>
<p>Note that the 4-space <strong>indentation</strong> rule applies here too.</p>
<p>As you may soon find out, programmers do like all sorts of shortcuts. For conditional expressions, there's a trick as well – you can write an if-else statement in one line. This is called a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/5932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a ternary operator, also known as a conditional expression, is a concise way to write an if-else statement in one line. | It has the syntax: `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`. The operation order follows a left-to-right convention, and the code should still be readable and maintainable. The condition is always a boolean expression, and the ternary operator allows for a block of code to be executed only if a specified condition is true.">ternary operator</a> </strong>and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("It’s a day now!" if sun else "It’s a night for sure!")</code></pre>
<p>Or, more generally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">first_alternative if condition else second_alternative</code></pre>
<p>It's a matter of convenience, but remember that the code you create should still be readable.</p>
<h5 id="nested-if-else" style="text-align: center;">Nested if-else</h5>
<p>It should be mentioned that <code class="language-python">if-else</code> statements can be <strong>nested</strong> the same way as <code class="language-python">if</code> statements. An additional conditional expression may appear after the <code class="language-python">if</code> section as well as after the <code class="language-python">else</code> section. Once again, don't forget to indent properly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if x &lt; 100:
    print('x &lt; 100')
else:
    if x == 100:
        print('x = 100')
    else:
        print('x &gt; 100')
    print('This will be printed only because x &gt;= 100')</code></pre>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>In this topic, we've learned about one more type of conditional expression: if-else statement. Let's go through the main points again:</p>
<ul>
<li>the keyword <code class="language-python">else</code> is used to give an alternative;</li>
<li>it will be executed in case <code class="language-python">if</code> statement isn't;</li>
<li>it doesn't require any condition;</li>
<li><code class="language-python">if-else</code> statements can be nested.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! Now you are ready not only to set conditions but also to consider different alternatives. Congratulations!</p>
