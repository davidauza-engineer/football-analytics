<p>In programming languages, the boolean, or logical, type is a common way to represent something that has only two opposite states like <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>, <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>, etc. It's a very useful type which you will quickly see for yourself when you start working on your projects or even write small programs. In this topic, we'll look at the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a boolean type is a special data type that has only two possible values: True or False. | These values are used to represent the two opposite states of a condition, such as on or off, yes or no. Boolean values are often used in programming to make decisions or evaluate expressions. For instance, if you are writing a program to monitor a door's state, you can use a boolean variable to store whether the door is currently open or closed. In Python, boolean values are capitalized, and they can be used in various operations, such as logical operations (AND, OR, NOT), truthy tests, and conversions to boolean. It is important to note that Python has a concept of truthy and falsy values, which means that some values, such as an empty list or an empty string, are considered false when evaluated in a boolean context. On the other hand, non-empty values, such as a non-empty list or a non-empty string, are considered true. The bool() function can be used to convert a value to a boolean, and it is useful when you want to ensure that a value is explicitly converted to a boolean before using it in a boolean context.">boolean type</a> in Python and learn how to use it.</p>

<p>There are three built-in boolean operators in Python: <code class="language-python">and</code>, <code class="language-python">or</code> and <code class="language-python">not</code>. The first two are <strong>binary</strong> operators which means that they expect two operands. <code class="language-python">not</code> is a <strong>unary</strong> operator, it is always applied to a single operand. First, let's look at these operators applied to the boolean values.</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>and</strong> is a binary operator, it takes two arguments and returns <code class="language-python">True</code> if both arguments are true, otherwise, it returns <code class="language-python">False</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-python">a = True and True    # True

<h5 id="the-precedence-of-boolean-operations">The precedence of boolean operations</h5>
<p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, logical operators are used to combine one or more conditional statements. | There are three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. These operators allow you to create more complex conditions by combining simple ones. The `and` operator returns `True` if both statements are true, otherwise, it returns `False`. The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the statements is true, otherwise, it returns `False`. The `not` operator is a unary operator that reverses the boolean value of its argument. It returns `False` if its argument is `True`, and `True` if its argument is `False`. Logical operators have a different priority, affecting the order of evaluation.">Logical operators</a> have a different priority and it affects the order of evaluation. Here are the operators in order of their priorities:</p>
<p>1. <code class="language-python">not</code></p>
<p>2. <code class="language-python">and</code></p>
<p>3. <code class="language-python">or</code></p>
<p>So, <code class="language-python">not</code> is considered first, then <code class="language-python">and</code>, finally <code class="language-python">or</code>. Having this in mind, consider the following expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(False or not False)  # True</code></pre>
<p>First, the part <code class="language-python">not False</code> gets evaluated, and after evaluation, we are left with <code class="language-python">False or True</code>. This results in <code class="language-python">True</code>, if you recall the previous section.</p>
<p>While dealing solely with the boolean values may seem obvious, the precedence of logical operations will be quite important to remember when you start working with so-called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a truthy is a value that is considered true when converted to a boolean. | This includes non-boolean values such as integers or strings, and depends on whether they are interpreted as empty or not. Values that are considered falsy include the constant false, zero of any numeric type, empty sequences and containers, and the null value (None). Any other value is considered truthy. Truthy and falsy values are used in logical operations and are evaluated based on operator precedence. The bool() function can be used to explicitly convert a value to a boolean.">truthy</a></strong> and <strong>falsy</strong> values.</p>
<h5 id="truthy-and-falsy-values">Truthy and falsy values</h5>
<p>Though Python has the boolean data type, we often want to use non-boolean values in a logical context. And Python lets you test almost any object for truthfulness. When used with logical operators, values of non-boolean types, such as integers or strings, are called <strong>truthy</strong> or <strong>falsy</strong>. It depends on whether they are interpreted as <code class="language-python">True</code> or <code class="language-python">False</code>.</p>
<p>The following values are evaluated to <code class="language-python">False</code> in Python:</p>
<ul><li><p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a constant is a type of variable that, once assigned a value, cannot be reassigned. | However, Python does not have built-in support for constants, and variable names are not enforced to be constant. Instead, programmers use naming conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. In the context of the provided text, the discussion revolves around two specific constants, `inf` and `-inf`, which represent positive and negative infinity, respectively. These constants are part of the floating-point arithmetic system and follow the same rules as other floating-point numbers. They can be used in arithmetic operations, and their use can optimize algorithms and find the lowest and highest values in a list of values.">constants</a> defined to be false: <code class="language-python">None</code> and <code class="language-python">False</code>,</p></li><li><p>zero of any numeric type: <code class="language-python">0</code>, <code class="language-python">0.0</code>,</p></li><li><p>empty <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a sequence is a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a particular order. | It includes lists, tuples, and strings. Sequences are characterized by their ability to be indexed, sliced, and iterated over. Indexing allows you to access individual elements of the sequence by their position, slicing allows you to extract a subset of the sequence, and iteration allows you to loop through the elements of the sequence. Additionally, sequences are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.">sequences</a> and containers: <code class="language-python">""</code>, <code class="language-python">[]</code>, <code class="language-python">{}</code>.</p></li></ul>
<p>Anything else generally evaluates to <code class="language-python">True</code>. Here is a couple of examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(0.0 or False)  # False
print("True" and True)  # True
print("" or False)  # False</code></pre>
<p>Generally speaking, <code class="language-python">and</code> and <code class="language-python">or</code> could take any arguments that can be tested for a boolean value.</p>
<p>Now we can demonstrate more clearly the difference in operator precedence:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># `and` has a higher priority than `or`
truthy_integer = False or 5 and 100  # 100</code></pre>
<p>Again, let's break the above expression into parts. Since the operator <code class="language-python">and</code> has a higher priority than <code class="language-python">or</code>, we should look at the <code class="language-python">5 and 100</code> part. Both <code class="language-python">100</code> and <code class="language-python">5</code> happen to be truthy values, so this operation will return <code class="language-python">100</code>. You have never seen this before, so it's natural to wonder why we have a number instead of the <code class="language-python">True</code> value here. The explanation is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>The operators <code class="language-python">or</code> and <code class="language-python">and</code> return one of their operands, not necessarily of the boolean type (see details below). Nonetheless, <code class="language-python">not</code> always returns a boolean value.</p></div>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-python">and</code> returns the first value if it evaluates to <code class="language-python">False</code>, otherwise it returns the second value.</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; False and True
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; True and True
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; True and False
False</code></pre>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-python">or</code> returns the first value if it evaluates to <code class="language-python">True</code>, otherwise it returns the second value.</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; True or False
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; False or True
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; True or True
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; False or False
False</code></pre>
<p>Coming back to the original expression, you can see that the last part <code class="language-python">False or 100</code> does exactly the same thing, returns <code class="language-python">100</code> instead of <code class="language-python">True</code>.</p>
<p>Another tricky example is below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">tricky = not (False or '')  # True</code></pre>
<p>A pair of parentheses is a way to specify the order in which the operations are performed. Thus, we evaluate this part of the expression first: <code class="language-python">False or ''</code>. This operand <code class="language-python">''</code> evaluates to <code class="language-python">False</code> and <code class="language-python">or</code> returns this empty string. Since the result of the enclosed expression is <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a negated expression is a type of operation that reverses the logical state of its operand. | In the context of regular expressions, a negative lookbehind is a pattern that matches a string only if it is not preceded by a specific pattern. It's an assertion that checks the preceding text but does not include it in the match. Negative lookbehinds are useful for excluding certain matches. For example, the pattern (?&lt;!foo) bar would match bar only if it is not preceded by foo. It's important to note that the length of the lookbehind pattern must be fixed, meaning that you can't use quantifiers such as * or + within a negative lookbehind. In the context of sets, a negated shorthand is a character that is banned by the negated shorthand, but can be added to the set to expand its scope. For example, the set [^a-zA-Z0-9] matches no alphanumeric character except for the comma and period. The unary operator ~ creates a new value, which by default has the boolean type. So, the unary operator always returns a logical value.">negated</a>, we get <code class="language-python">True</code> in the end: <code class="language-python">not ''</code> is the same as <code class="language-python">True</code>. Why didn't we get, say, a non-empty string? The <code class="language-python">not</code> operator creates a new value, which by default has the boolean type. So, as stated earlier, the unary operator always returns a logical value.</p>
<h5 id="short-circuit-evaluation">Short-circuit evaluation</h5>
<p>The last thing to mention is that logical operators in Python are <strong>short-circuited</strong>. That's why they are also called <strong>lazy</strong>. That means that the second operand in such an expression is evaluated only if the first one is not sufficient to evaluate the whole expression.</p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-python">x and y</code> returns x if x is falsy; otherwise, it evaluates and returns y.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-python">x or y</code> returns x if x is truthy; otherwise, it evaluates and returns y.</p></li></ul>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># division is never evaluated, because the first argument is True
lazy_or = True or (1 / 0)  # True

# division is never evaluated, because the first argument is False
lazy_and = False and (1 / 0)  # False</code></pre>
