<p></p><p>Imagine you're working on a text-to-speech system, which reads phone numbers aloud. The input phone number will consist solely of digits. Your task is to print the name of each digit on a new line for the system to read them one by one.</p><p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> You can store the digit names in a container, e.g. in a list with the names from 0 to 9 <code class="java">digits = ['zero', 'one', 'two', ..., 'nine']</code>, and refer to each digit name by its index, i.e. sequence number (starting with 0) of an element in the list, then, in this case, <code class="java">digits[2]</code> equals to <code class="java">'two'</code>, etc. Mind the type, <strong>an index should be an integer</strong>, not a string. Recall, that in order to convert a string to an integer you need to use <code class="java">int()</code> function.</p><p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> It may be a good idea to store the initial input as a string, not as an integer, even though it only consists of digits.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4901825</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">four<br>nine<br>zero<br>one<br>eight<br>two<br>five</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
