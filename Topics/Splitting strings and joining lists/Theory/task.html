<p>In Python, strings and lists are quite similar. Firstly, they both pertain to <strong>sequences</strong>, although strings are limited to characters while lists can store data of different types. In addition, you can <strong>iterate </strong>both over strings and lists. However, sometimes you need to turn a string into a list or vice versa. Python has these kinds of tools. The methods that will help you to accomplish this task are <code class="language-python">split()</code>, <code class="language-python">join()</code>, and <code class="language-python">splitlines()</code>.</p>
<h5 id="split-a-string">Split a string</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-python">split()</code> method divides a string into substrings by a <strong>separator</strong>. If the separator isn't given, whitespace is used as a default. The method returns a <strong>list</strong> of all the substrings and, notably, the separator itself is not included in any of the substrings.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># split example
definition = input()  # 'Coin of the realm is the legal money of the country' 

definition.split()
# ['Coin', 'of', 'the', 'realm', 'is', 'the', 'legal', 'money', 'of', 'the', 'country']

definition.split("legal")
# ['Coin of the realm is the ', ' money of the country']</code></pre>
<p>You can also specify how many times the split is going to be done with the <code class="language-python">maxsplit</code> argument that comes after the separator. The number of elements in the resulting list will be equal to <code class="language-python">maxsplit + 1</code>.</p>
<p>If the argument isn't specified, all possible splits are made.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># maxsplit example
definition = input()  # 'Coin of the realm is the legal money of the country'

definition.split("of", 1)
# ['Coin ', ' the realm is the legal money of the country']

definition.split("of")
# ['Coin ', ' the realm is the legal money ', ' the country']
</code></pre>
<p>If the separator doesn't occur in the string, then the result of the method is a list with the original string as its only element:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">definition = input()  # 'Coin of the realm is the legal money of the country'

definition.split("hi!")  # wrong separator
# ['Coin of the realm is the legal money of the country']</code></pre>
<p>Thus, in all cases <code class="language-python">split()</code> allows us to convert a string into a list.</p>
<p>It may also be useful to read input directly into several variables with <code class="language-python">split()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name, surname = input().split()  # Forrest Gump

print(name)     # Forrest
print(surname)  # Gump</code></pre>
<p>It's pretty efficient when you know the exact number of input values. In case you don't, it's likely to result in <code class="language-python">ValueError</code> with a message telling you either that there are too many values to unpack or not enough of them. So keep that in mind!</p>
<h5 id="join-a-list">Join a list</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-python">join()</code> method is used to create a string out of a collection of strings. However, its use has a number of limitations. First, the argument of the method must be an <strong>iterable object</strong> with strings as its elements. And second, the method must be applied to a <strong>separator</strong>: a string that will separate the elements in a resulting string object. See below the examples of that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">word_list  = ["dog", "cat", "rabbit", "parrot"]

" ".join(word_list)  # "dog cat rabbit parrot"
"".join(word_list)  # "dogcatrabbitparrot"
"_".join(word_list)  # "dog_cat_rabbit_parrot"
" and ".join(word_list)  # "dog and cat and rabbit and parrot"</code></pre>
<p>Note that this method only works if the elements in the iterable object are <strong>strings</strong>. If, for example, you want to create a string of integers, it will not work. In this case, you need to convert the integers into strings explicitly or just work with strings right from the outset.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">int_list = [1, 2, 3]
" ".join(int_list)  # TypeError!

str_list = ["1", "2", "3"]
" ".join(str_list)  # "1 2 3"
</code></pre>
<h5 id="split-multiple-lines">Split multiple lines</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-python">splitlines()</code> method is similar to <code class="language-python">split()</code>, but it is used specifically to split the string by the line boundaries. There are many <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6972" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an escape sequence is a set of characters used to represent a special character or action within a string. | Escape sequences begin with a backslash (\) followed by a specific character. For example, the escape sequence \n represents a new line, and \t represents a tab. These sequences allow for the formatting of strings in a concise and standardized way. When a string contains an escape sequence, it is treated as a single character for most string methods, such as len(), but is displayed as its corresponding special character when printed.">escape sequences</a> that signify the end of the line, but the <code class="language-python">split()</code> method can only take one separator. So this is where the <code class="language-python">splitlines()</code> method comes in handy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># splitlines example ('\r' is a carriage return)
long_text = 'first line\nsecond line\rthird line\r\nfourth line'

long_text.splitlines()
# ['first line', 'second line', 'third line', 'fourth line']</code></pre>
<p>The method has an optional argument <code class="language-python">keepends</code> that has a True or False value. If <code class="language-python">keepends = True</code> linebreaks are included in the resulting list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># keepends
long_text = 'first line\nsecond line\rthird line\r\nfourth line'

long_text.splitlines(keepends=True)
# ['first line\n', 'second line\r', 'third line\r\n', 'fourth line']</code></pre>
<p>You can also use several <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6972" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string method is a built-in function that allows you to perform various operations on a string object, such as manipulating, extracting, or modifying the string's content. | It's important to note that strings in Python are immutable, meaning that these methods do not modify the original string but instead return a new string as a result. For example, the `split()` method splits a string into a list where each word is a list item, while the `join()` method combines the elements of a list into a single string with a specified delimiter. When using these methods, it's essential to assign the result to a new variable if you want to use the modified string several times, as the original string remains unchanged. Additionally, string methods have various parameters that you can adjust according to your needs.">string methods</a> at once. It is called <strong>chaining, </strong>and it works because most of the string methods return a string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># chaining example
sent = input()  # "Mary had a little lamb"
new_sent = sent.lower().split()
# ["mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"]</code></pre>
<p>But do not get carried away, because the length of a line should be no more than 79 characters, and we definitely do not want to break PEP 8! Also, note that order of methods in chaining matters. <code class="language-python">sent.split().lower()</code> will throw an error because the method <code class="language-python">split()</code> returns a list, and applying <code class="language-python">lower()</code> to a list is not supported.</p>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>We have learned how to convert strings to lists via the <code class="language-python">split()</code> and <code class="language-python">splitlines()</code> methods, and how to get strings back from lists via the <code class="language-python">join()</code> method. As a recap, consider the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Splitting and joining methods <strong>do not change</strong> the original string.</p></li><li><p>If you need to use the "changed" string several times, you need to assign the result of the respective method to a variable.</p></li><li><p>If you need to use this result only once, you can work with it on spot, for example, <code class="language-python">print()</code> it.</p></li><li><p>There are a lot of parameters in string methods.
