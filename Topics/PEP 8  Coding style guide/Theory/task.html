<p style="text-align: start">Today, we took a dive into the world of Python with some cool PEP 8 guidelines that help keep your code looking sharp and easy to read. Let's do a quick wrap-up:</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>Indentation</strong>: Think of indentation like paragraph breaks in a story â€” it helps define where new <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47499" target="_blank" title="In Python, a block of code refers to a group of consecutive lines of code that are executed as a single unit. | It is typically defined by a header line, also known as a line that starts with a keyword such as 'if', 'for', 'while', or 'def'. The header line is followed by one or more indented lines of code that make up the block. These indented lines are executed only if the condition specified in the header line is true. Proper indentation is crucial for the block of code to work correctly. Blocks of code can be nested, meaning that a block of code can contain another block of code.">blocks of code</a> start and end. Remember, a neat 4-space indent is your best friend in Python to keep everything tidy and understandable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Line length</strong>: Keeping your code lines short, no more than 79 characters, is like not letting a sentence run on for too long. It keeps your code easy on the eyes and super straightforward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Naming <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47499" target="_blank" title="In Python, a constant is a type of variable that, once assigned a value, cannot be reassigned. | However, Python does not have built-in support for constants, and variable names are not enforced to be constant. Instead, programmers use naming conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant. In the context of the provided text, the discussion revolves around two specific constants, `inf` and `-inf`, which represent positive and negative infinity, respectively. These constants are part of the floating-point arithmetic system and follow the same rules as other floating-point numbers. They can be used in arithmetic operations, and their use can optimize algorithms and find the lowest and highest values in a list of values.">constants</a> and variables:</strong> Shouting in all caps (with underscores to break up words) is the way to go for constants like <code class="java">MAX_HEIGHT</code>. For variables, stick to lowercase with underscores, like <code class="java">height</code>. This helps tell them apart at a glance, making your code cleaner and more organized.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quotation marks for strings</strong>: Whether you choose single or double quotes, just keep it consistent throughout your project. Itâ€™s like picking a font and sticking with it for a whole document â€” keeps things looking uniform.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spacing</strong>: Avoid stuffing spaces where they donâ€™t belong â€” like inside parentheses or right after a function name. Keeping these spaces in check ensures your code doesnâ€™t look cluttered. However, don't forget to add space around binary operators (<code class="java">+</code>, <code class="java">-</code>, <code class="java">*</code>, <code class="java">/</code>, <code class="java">=</code>, <code class="java">==</code>) to improve readability.</p></li></ol>
<p>By sticking to these PEP 8 rules, youâ€™re not just coding â€” youâ€™re crafting an art piece thatâ€™s a breeze to read and maintain. Think of these guidelines as the secret ingredients that make your code stand out in the bustling world of programming.
