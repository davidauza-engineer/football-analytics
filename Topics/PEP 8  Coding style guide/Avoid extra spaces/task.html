print('I have an extra space before closing parenthesis!' )
print( 'I have two extra spaces inside parentheses!' )
print  ('I have space after function name')</code></pre><p>Here is a good example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print('I follow the PEP-8 rule!')</code></pre><p>Now, please review the examples provided below and match them with the corresponding descriptions.</p>
