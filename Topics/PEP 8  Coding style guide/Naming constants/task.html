<p style="text-align: start">In Python, there's a neat convention for naming constants: they should be written in <strong>all capital letters with underscores separating words.</strong> This convention helps differentiate constants from variables, making your code clearer and easier to understand.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Whatâ€™s a constant, you ask?</strong> A constant is a type of variable whose value doesn't change throughout the program. By convention, we use uppercase letters to name them, which signals to other programmers that these values should remain unchanged.</p><p style="text-align: start"><strong>Example</strong>:</p><pre><code class="java">MAX_SIZE = 100
PI = 3.14159
DATABASE_URL = "https://example.com/data"</code></pre><p style="text-align: start">In these examples, <code class="java">MAX_SIZE</code>, <code class="java">PI</code>, and <code class="java">DATABASE_URL</code> are constants. Their names are in all caps with underscores separating words, which immediately tells you, "Hey, these values are constants and should not be modified!"</p><p style="text-align: start">How about you review the names listed below and identify which ones are constants?</p>
