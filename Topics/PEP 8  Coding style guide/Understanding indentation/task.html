<p>Letâ€™s dive into something super crucial in Python: <strong>indentation</strong>! ðŸ¤“ Imagine you're writing down instructions for a day's plan. Each main activity starts at the left margin, but if an activity has specific steps, those steps are indented to show they belong to the main activity. Here's a non-coding example:</p><pre><code class="java">Breakfast
    - Make coffee
    - Cook eggs
Lunch
    - Buy groceries
    - Prepare salad</code></pre><p>This is similar to how Python uses indentation to group lines of code that work together. Itâ€™s not just for looks; it actually tells Python that a new block of code is starting, helping both Python and any programmer reading the code to understand it easily. More about this in the next step.</p><p>Before moving on, can you please select the reason behind using indentation in Python?</p>
