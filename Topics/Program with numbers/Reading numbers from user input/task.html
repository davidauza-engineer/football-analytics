<p>Since you have become familiar with the <code class="language-python">input()</code> function in Python, it's hardly new to you that any data passed to this function is treated as a <strong>string</strong>.</p><p>But how should we deal with numerical values? As a general rule, they are explicitly converted to corresponding <strong>numerical types. </strong>To do it, we add data type before input:</p><pre><code class="language-python">integer = int(input())
floating_point = float(input())</code></pre><p>Now, we can treat them as numbers, and not strings. So, if the user inputs <code class="language-python">4</code> and <code class="language-python">2.5</code>, the value of <code class="language-python">sum = integer + floating_point</code> would be:</p>
