<p>Whenever you use an equal sign <code class="language-python">=</code>, you actually assign some value to a variable. For that reason, <code class="language-python">=</code> is typically referred to as an <strong>assignment operator</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are other assignment operators you can use in Python. They are also called <strong>compound assignment operators</strong>, for they carry out an arithmetic operation and assignment in one step. Have a look at the code snippet below:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># simple assignment
number = 10
number = number + 1  # 11</code></pre><p>This code is equivalent to the following one:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># compound assignment
number = 10
number += 1  # 11</code></pre><p>One can clearly see from the example that the second piece of code is more concise (for it doesn't repeat the variable's name). Naturally, similar assignment forms exist for the rest of arithmetic operations.</p><p>If you’re coming from a language like C++, you might expect that <code class="language-python">++</code> or <code class="language-python">--</code> operators will increase or decrease a value in Python. However, <strong>Python does not support these operators</strong>, so be mindful and use <code class="language-python">+=</code> or <code class="language-python">-=</code> for incrementing or decrementing values. And, <code class="language-python">==</code> is a comparison operator, which we’ll cover later, not a compound assignment operator.</p><p>Select all the options that contain compound assignment operators:</p>
