<p>Thus, we have shed some light on new details about integer arithmetic and the processing of numerical inputs in Python. The key takeaways are just two:</p>
<ul><li><p>We can convert the numeric <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/47734" target="_blank" title="In Python, user input refers to the data or value that is entered by the user and read by a program. | This input is typically obtained using the `input()` function, which displays a prompt to the user and waits for them to enter a value. The function then returns the entered value as a string, which can be stored in a variable for later use. It is important to note that user input can be unpredictable and may not always be in the expected format, so it is often necessary to validate and/or convert the input before using it in a program.">user input</a> with the help of <code class="java">int(input())</code> or <code class="java">float(input())</code></p></li><li><p>There are compound assignment operators, such as <code class="java">+=</code>, <code class="java">-=</code>, <code class="java">*=</code>, which make the code shorter and more readable.</p></li></ul>
<p>You definitely know a lot more on integer arithmetic, however, the learning journey of a developer is never over.</p>
